### 🧭 About Me

I'm currently studying Computer Science and engineering my way through Python, cybersecurity, and system-level programming.  
My focus is on building things that actually make sense — logically, structurally, and practically.  
I value clarity over shortcuts, curiosity over comfort, and depth over buzzwords.

- 🛡️ Cybersecurity (CTFs, packet analysis, exploit basics)
- 🧵 Systems thinking & OS internals
- 💡 Low-level problem solving and reverse engineering
- ⚙️ Automating boring stuff with Python
- 🧪 Writing clean code and breaking messy ones

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech

```bash
Languages: Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
OS:       Linux (daily), Windows (when needed)
Editor:   VS Code, Vim, Pycharm (slowly converting...)

### 📚 Philosophy

I’m not just here to write code.  
I’m here to understand what’s going on *underneath* it — from logic gates to ports and payloads.  
If something seems too complex, I probably want to break it down and rebuild it better.
